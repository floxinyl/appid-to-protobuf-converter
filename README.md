## üîç How to Get Your Access Token

To hide games using Postman or similar tools, you need your Steam access token. Here's how to find it:

1. **Open the Steam Website**:
   - Visit [https://steamcommunity.com/my](https://steamcommunity.com/my) and log in to your account.

2. **Access Developer Tools**:
   - Press `F12` or right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect**.
   - Navigate to the **Network** tab in the developer tools.

3. **Reload the Page**:
   - Press `CTRL+R` to reload the page while keeping the developer tools open.

4. **Find the Access Token**:
   - Look for a network request with `v1?access_token=` in its URL.
   - Click on the request to view its details.

5. **Copy the Token**:
   - Go to the **Payload** tab of the request details.
   - Find the `access_token` field and copy the long string following it.

   > **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Keep your access token private. Sharing it can compromise your Steam account security.

Once you have the token, you can use it with Postman or other tools to send requests to Steam's API.
